# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Dana would like a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape. Goal is to add table filters for criteria other than date.

1. Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings using multiple criterias
2. Deliverable 2: complete written report (readme file).
