# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Dana would like a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape. Goal is to add table filters for criteria other than date.

1. Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings using multiple criterias
2. Deliverable 2: complete written report (readme file).

## Results
Our webpage has a navigation bar, page header, article title, article paragraph, filters for the table, and table of sightings data which can be seen [here](https://github.com/MuddassirR/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/html%20file.png). Someone navigating through this webpage may want to filter for UFO sightings based on criteria such as the shape of the UFO, which can be done. As shown in this [picture](https://github.com/MuddassirR/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/circlefiltered.png), you can filter UFO sightings based on the shape of the UFO, in this case 'circle', and you can combine filters as well as shown in this [picture](https://github.com/MuddassirR/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/circle%26state.png) which combines shape and state filters. To reset filters, you can click "Clear Table" which would erase all the filters you have written and display all the results again.
